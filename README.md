## 🛠️ Usage

To use this project, you can train the model on your own dataset of X-ray images. Make sure your dataset is organized in the following format:

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── broken/      # X-ray images with fractures
│   └── healthy/     # X-ray images without fractures
└── test/
    ├── broken/      # Test images with fractures
    └── healthy/     # Test images without fractures
```

Once your data is set up, run the cells in the provided Jupyter notebook to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Results

Here are some of the results from the trained model:

- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 89%
- **Recall**: 90%
- **F1-score**: 89%
